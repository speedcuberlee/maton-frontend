					<p>Amid the trials of the early pandemic, the Internet Archive’s transition to remote work in March
						2020 brought the challenge of maintaining engagement for our all-staff virtual meetings. In
						April 2020, we devised a creative solution: biweekly performances by musicians preceding our
						Monday and Friday meetings. Dubbed “<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/essential-music-concerts-from-home">Essential Music
							Concerts from Home</a>,” this initiative mirrored the enticement of providing donuts or
						snacks to draw attendees to a staff gathering. Now, as we mark its 4th anniversary, we extend
						our gratitude to Producer/Manager <a href="https://1888media.wordpress.com/">Rob Evanoff</a> for
						his contributions, bringing over 50 artists to our virtual stage.</p>



					<p>In tribute to Rob’s impact, we’d like to highlight several of the artists he represents.</p>

					<p><strong>From left:</strong> Aruba’s National Librarian, Astrid Britten (Director, Biblioteca
						Nacional Aruba), signs the statement protecting memory organizations online as Raymond Hernandez
						(Director, Archivo Nacional Aruba) and Brewster Kahle (Founder, Internet Archive) look on.</p>



					<p><strong>This was a week of firsts in Aruba.</strong> The small island nation in the southern
						Caribbean launched its new heritage portal, the <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">Aruba Collection (Coleccion Aruba</a>), and it
						became the first country to sign a statement to <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/four-digital-rights-for-protecting-memory-institutions-online">protect
							the digital rights</a> of libraries &amp; other memory institutions.</p>



					<p>Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle and Chris Freeland, director of library services at the
						Archive, attended the signing ceremony in Aruba, a country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands
						located 18 miles north of Venezuela.</p>



					<p>Support for the statement, <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/four-digital-rights-for-protecting-memory-institutions-online">Four
							Digital Rights For Protecting Memory Institutions Online</a>, was spearheaded by Peter
						Scholing, information scientist and researcher at the country’s national library, Biblioteca
						Nacional Aruba (BNA). Last fall, he learned about the need for library digital rights to be
						championed during a conference at the Internet Archive in San Francisco. While much of that
						discussion was based on the 2022 <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/bailey-menna-securing-digital-rights-for-libraries">report</a>,
						“Securing Digital Rights for Libraries: Towards an Affirmative Policy Agenda for a Better
						Internet,” authored by Lila Bailey and Michael Menna, and focused on protecting library access
						to e-books, Scholing was interested in Aruba making a broader statement—one encompassing all
						memory institutions and the diverse types of materials they house.</p>



					<p>“Over the last few months we’ve brainstormed about these digital rights and how to broaden the
						statement to make it relevant to not only libraries, but also for memory institutions and GLAMs
						in general,” said Scholing, using the acronym for galleries, libraries, archives &amp; museums.
						“In that sense, it has become a near universal declaration for open access to information, in
						line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (<a
							href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">UN 2030 Agenda/Sustainable Development Goals,
							#16.10</a>) or other statements on open access to documentary, cultural or digital heritage.
						This aligns almost perfectly with what we aim to achieve here on Aruba—universal access to “our”
						information.”</p>



					<p>Many memory institutions on the island have long worked together to digitize collections
						including books, government documents, photos and videos. The statement reinforces the
						importance of libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions being able to fulfill
						their mission by preserving knowledge for the public to access.</p>



					<p><strong>Initial Signing Organizations</strong></p>



					<ul>
						<li>Archivo Nacional Aruba (ANA)</li>



						<li>Aruban National Committee for UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme</li>



						<li>Biblioteca Nacional Aruba (BNA)</li>



						<li>Coleccion Aruba</li>



						<li>Museo Arkeologico Nacional Aruba (MANA)</li>



						<li>Stichting Monumentenfonds Aruba</li>



						<li>Union di Organisacionnan Cultural Arubano (UNOCA)</li>
					</ul>



					<p>The statement asserts that the rights and responsibilities that memory institutions have always
						enjoyed offline must also be protected online. To accomplish this goal, libraries, archives and
						museums must have the legal rights and practical ability to:</p>



					<ul>
						<li><strong>Collect digital materials</strong>, including those made available only via
							streaming and other restricted means, through purchase on the open market or any other legal
							means, no matter the underlying file format;</li>



						<li><strong>Preserve those materials</strong>, and where necessary repair or reformat them, to
							ensure their long-term existence and availability;</li>



						<li><strong>Provide controlled access to digital materials</strong> for advanced research
							techniques and to patrons where they are—online;</li>



						<li><strong>Cooperate with other memory institutions</strong>, by sharing or transferring
							digital collections, so as to provide more equitable access for communities in remote and
							less well-funded areas.</li>
					</ul>

							THE STATEMENT</a></h2>



					<p>In Aruba, Scholing said library and archive leaders believed strongly that these rights should be
						upheld with a public endorsement. Michael Menna, co-author of the statement and the 2022 report,
						saw this as a key first step in building a coalition of memory institutions.</p>



					<p>“Aruba has been brave to make such a clear and unequivocal statement about the many challenges
						facing libraries, archives, and museums,” said Menna. “Simply put, these essential institutions
						need better protections to adapt their services to today’s media environment. Hopefully, after
						hearing Aruba speak out, others can follow suit.”</p>



					<p>Report co-author Lila Bailey, senior policy counsel at the Internet Archive, said that seeing the
						statement embraced and endorsed by memory institutions is rewarding.</p>



					<p>“It is a thrill to see Aruba leading the way towards a better digital future for memory
						institutions worldwide,” said Bailey. “These institutions must meet the needs of a modern public
						using the best tools available. It is good public policy and basic common sense that libraries,
						archives and museums should be not only permitted but encouraged to leverage digital
						technologies to serve their essential public functions.”</p>



					<p class="has-light-gray-background-color has-background">The <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/four-digital-rights-for-protecting-memory-institutions-online">statement</a>
						can be endorsed by governments, organizations, and individuals following a verification process.

					<p>Many know Aruba as a popular tourist destination with beautiful beaches. The small island nation
						just north of Venezuela is also home to 110,000 inhabitants with a rich history—that many are
						working to preserve.</p>



					<p>Aruba’s memory institutions have been digitizing materials for years. Initially, residents and
						international scholars could only view the items at the library on the island. But now with the
						help of Internet Archive, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">Aruba Collection
							(Coleccion Aruba</a>) is available to anyone for free from anywhere. </p>



					<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><a
							href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">EXPLORE THE COLECCION ARUBA</a></h2>



					<p>A celebration of the heritage portal’s launch is being held <a
							href="https://coleccion.aw/stream">via livestream</a> on April 8.</p>



					<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>COLLABORATION IS KEY</strong></h2>



					<p>Digitizing the island’s historic materials was a collaborative effort. After Aruba became a
						country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986, the national library (<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/bibliotecanacionalaruba">Biblioteca Nacional Aruba; Aruba
							National Library – BNA)</a> and the national archives (<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/archivo-nacional-aruba">Archivo Nacional Aruba; National
							Archives of Aruba – ANA)</a> were established. Leaders from the two institutions worked
						together to curate and scan artifacts including newspapers, government reports, and cultural
						items.</p>



					<p>“Aruba has a challenging past due to migration, colonization, and slavery,” said Peter Scholing,
						information specialist/researcher at BNA, the national library. “That means there has been a
						diaspora of people coming in and spreading out throughout the world—the same goes for our
						collection and documents.”</p>



					<p>Locating materials to digitize involved several local institutions on the island. Because the
						materials are scattered, Aruba has branched out to collaborate with others in the Caribbean,
						Venezuela, Netherlands and the United States. The local leaders established protocols and
						standards for the collection, but didn’t have enough resources to make the materials available
						in a robust digital library.</p>

					</figure>



					<p>Connecting with the Internet Archive to host the digital collection provided the missing piece of
						the puzzle, according to leaders in Aruba. “Because of the reality of our small island state, we
						don’t have much funding for big company servers,” said Raymond Hernandez, head of the Aruba
						National Archives (ANA). “If you have a limited budget, it’s not possible. The dream has come
						true, thanks to the Internet Archive. We are very grateful.”<br><br>The new portal on the
						Internet Archive devoted to Aruba includes links to the several other institutions such as<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/unoca"> UNOCA (Union di Organisacionnan Cultural Arubano
							(UNOCA)</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/mana.aw">&nbsp;Museo Arkeologico Nacional
							Aruba (MANA); National Archaeological Museum Aruba</a>;<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/monumentsfundaruba"> Stichting Monumentenfonds Aruba
							(SMFA); Monuments Fund of Aruba)</a>,<a href="https://archive.org/details/cultura.aw">
							Departamento di Cultura Aruba</a>,<a href="https://archive.org/details/universityofaruba">
							University of Aruba</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/telearuba">TeleAruba</a> and<a

					<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><a
							href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">EXPLORE THE COLECCION ARUBA</a></h2>



					<p>The collection has more than 100,000 items to date — nearly a one-to-one ratio for the island’s
						population. This includes about 40,000 documents, 60,000 images, 900 videos, 45 audio files and
						seven 3D objects for a total of 67 thematic and/or institutional (sub)collections.</p>



					<p>As an additional layer of protection, the materials are being uploaded to the Filecoin&nbsp;

					<p>For Chelsea Schields, associate professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, the
						materials were so compelling and easy to use that she integrated them into her undergraduate
						course, “Oil and Capitalism.” Students learn about the global history of petroleum and develop
						research skills to build an argument based on evidence. “Students use the Aruba Collection to
						write research papers related to the culture of oil towns,” Schields said. “It is often their
						favorite part of the course because they get to dig into the sources themselves and identify the
						themes that resonate across those materials.”</p>



					<p>Unlike other primary source collections, which are often cumbersome and hidden behind a costly
						paywall, the diverse sources found enabled students to write papers on topics ranging from
						migrant domestic workers in Aruba to the spatial organization of oil towns.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>In her own research for <a
							href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520390812/offshore-attachments">a book</a> on the
						social histories of oil refineries on Aruba and Curaçao, Schields said the Aruba heritage portal
						was extremely useful when the COVID-19 pandemic restricted travel in the summer of 2020. “The
						Aruba Collection provided such an indispensable, bottom-up portrait of the history of the
						island’s Lago Refinery, which at its peak was among the largest plants in the world,” she said.
						“From photographs of refinery workers and their families to digitized copies of employee
						publications, these sources allowed me to see the labor required to transform oil into the
						commodities we rely upon today.”</p>

					<p>Since the launch of <a href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">Coleccion Aruba</a>, Adi Martis
						said he uses the website almost every day. The emeritus associate professor at Utrecht
						University in The Netherlands appreciates how easy it is to access a variety of materials in
						national archives and the national library collections.&nbsp; For example, by combining data
						from digitized historical maps and land ownership register books from the Aruban Land Registry,
						users can gain an insight into the history of land ownership on the island, he said.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>By applying AI-based, Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) algorithms, the digitized,
						difficult-to-read handwritten texts are made accessible to the public and transformed into
						searchable data. Martis said in some cases, digitized archives from Aruba, Curaçao and the
						Netherlands are combined and search results are sometimes surprising—in particular with data
						about the history of slavery. Users can search using different keywords and the site can even
						create family trees, which normally can be difficult because the slaves had no surnames.</p>



					<p>“For the past 50 years I have been doing archival research and I must admit that I am proud of my
						small island that was able to achieve such incredible results in such a short time with the help
						of Internet Archive,” Martis said.</p>



					<p>Jan Bant, a doctoral student in history from Aruba who lives in The Netherlands, relied heavily
						on the Coleccion Aruba when doing research for&nbsp; his master’s thesis in 2020 during the
						COVID-19 lockdown. Although he was unable to return to the island, he accessed journals and
						newspaper articles from Europe to examine Aruba’s political climate between in the 1970s and
						80s. Being able to enter key words and dates in the search function was particularly helpful in
						locating sources. Bant was able to uncover documents about protests, revealing the country’s
						somewhat radical traditions of commenting on world affairs despite its image as a calm player in
						the Caribbean, he said.</p>



					<p>As Bant continues his PhD research on the role of sports in Dutch Caribbean communities, he is
						tapping into the Coleccion Aruba, including materials about the oil refinery and laborers who
						brought baseball to the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



					<p>Bant contributed back to the portal by <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/BNA-DIG-TESIS-BANT-JAN-2021">uploading his completed
							master’s thesis</a>, which was completed in 2021. “There is a lot of research about Aruba
						that gets written but it’s never really used—often because people don’t know where to find it,”
						Bant said. “The Aruba Collection can also serve well as a repository to store research that has
						been done about Aruba. That’s what I think is very valuable.”</p>



					<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SERVING PATRONS</h2>



					<p>Aruba’s UNOCA Managing Director Ray-Anne Hernandez said the <a
							href="https://archive.org/details/aruba">heritage portal</a> allows users to easily search
						her foundation’s work of arts and culture. Researchers now can go to one place to locate
						digitized images and documents.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>“We have collections that we want to share and have accessible to the public, so this was a
						logical step to be part of this collaboration,” Hernadez said. “In the collection, we have
						history. We have art, music, and education. It’s so much more than we initially thought it would
						be and that fills us with great pride and great joy. It’s not just that we made a website. It’s
						something that’s continually growing and everybody is using it.”</p>



					<p>The Dutch Caribbean Digital Heritage Week will be held on Aruba April 8-12. For the first day,
						April 8, a day-long symposium is planned, titled “Connecting our Shared Heritage: Linking
						(Dutch) Caribbean Heritage Institutions and Collections”, with keynote speeches from Brewster
						Kahle (Internet Archive), Eppo van Nispen (Dutch Network for Digital Heritage NDE and
						Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision), and contributions from a wide range of heritage
						professionals from across the Dutch Caribbean, and the world. It will be livestreamed via <a
							href="https://coleccion.aw/stream">https://coleccion.aw/stream</a>.</p>

					<p>In early March 2020, much like the rest of the United States, the staff of the Internet Archive
						transitioned to fully remote work in anticipation of the prolonged pandemic. This change was
						monumental and, like all workplaces, we discovered the challenge of sustaining a feeling of
						connection, morale, and joy within the team.</p>



					<p>Recognizing this challenge, our Director of Media &amp; Access, Alexis Rossi, came up with a
						creative solution. It was already part of our workplace culture to have two weekly all-staff
						meetings—one at 10am PT Monday morning, and another at Friday lunch. As everyone moved to
						joining those meetings from home, Alexis began hosting short concerts before them by performers,
						particularly musicians, to uplift our team’s spirits. These concerts provided not only
						entertainment, but also a means of keeping our team engaged and the performers booked during
						uncertain times.</p>



					<p>The initiative began with a performance by Alexis’s friend, Jefferson Bergey, whose talent for
						musical theater and captivating stage presence set the stage. At the time, we envisioned
						organizing these concerts for just a few months, as none of us could predict the duration of the
						pandemic.<br><br>Fast forward several years and our work world has undergone a profound
						transformation. Encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response from our now mostly remote
						staff, we decided to continue the program, thus giving birth to “<a
							href="https://archive.org/details/essential-music-concerts-from-home?tab=collection">Essential
							Music Concerts From Home</a>.” As we approach our fourth anniversary in April, we reflect on
						how this simple yet impactful idea has helped sustain our remote workplace culture through the
						years. We thought it would be fun to offer you a glimpse into some of the unique musical
						encounters enjoyed by the Internet Archive staff with some exceptionally talented musicians.</p>

					<p>In the realm of classic cinema, few films possess the enduring charm and intrigue of “Charade.”
						Released in 1963, this romantic comedy-thriller captivated audiences with its charismatic leads,
						sophisticated plot twists, and stylish Parisian backdrop. Yet, behind its glamorous facade lies
						a curious tale of copyright ambiguity and the unexpected <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charade_(1963_film)#Public-domain_status">journey into
							the public domain</a>.</p>



					<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Charismatic Charade</strong></h1>



					<p>Directed by Stanley Donen, “Charade” stars the legendary Audrey Hepburn as Regina Lampert, a
						young woman entangled in a web of mystery following her husband’s murder. Alongside her is the
						incomparable Cary Grant, portraying the enigmatic Peter Joshua, whose true intentions remain
						shrouded in secrecy. The film’s witty dialogue, suspenseful plot, and undeniable chemistry
						between the leads made it an instant classic upon its release.</p>

					<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Copyright Conundrum Turned Opportunity</strong></h1>



					<p>“Charade” found itself in a unique predicament due to an oversight in its initial release—the
						omission of a copyright notice, which at the time meant that the movie was not protected by
						copyright at all (<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charade_(1963_film)#Public-domain_status">Wikipedia</a>).
						This unintentionally liberated the film, allowing it to enter the public domain in the United
						States.</p>



					<p>The absence of copyright protection transformed “Charade” into a cultural treasure, accessible to
						all. It paved the way for widespread distribution through television broadcasts, home video
						releases, and digital platforms, democratizing access to this cinematic gem.</p>

					<p>“Sinykin’s&nbsp;<em>Big Fiction</em>&nbsp;is a book of major ambition and many satisfactions.
						Come for the comprehensive reframing of a key phase in U.S. literary history, stay for the
						parade of interesting people, the fascinating backstories of bestsellers, the electrically
						entertaining prose. The story of literary publishing in the postwar period has never been told
						with such verve.” –&nbsp;<strong>Mark McGurl, author of&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Everything and
								Less: The Novel in the Age of Amazon</strong></em></p>

					<p>In the late 1950s, Random House editor Jason Epstein would talk jazz with Ralph Ellison or chat
						with Andy Warhol while pouring drinks in his office. By the 1970s, editors were poring over
						profit-and-loss statements. The electronics company RCA bought Random House in 1965, and then
						other large corporations purchased other formerly independent publishers. As multinational
						conglomerates consolidated the industry, the business of literature—and literature
						itself—transformed.<br><br>Dan Sinykin explores how changes in the publishing industry have
						affected fiction, literary form, and what it means to be an author. Giving an inside look at the
						industry’s daily routines, personal dramas, and institutional crises, he reveals how
						conglomeration has shaped what kinds of books and writers are published. Sinykin examines four
						different sectors of the publishing industry: mass-market books by brand-name authors like
						Danielle Steel; trade publishers that encouraged genre elements in literary fiction; nonprofits
						such as Graywolf that aspired to protect literature from market pressures; and the distinctive
						niche of employee-owned W. W. Norton. He emphasizes how women and people of color navigated
						shifts in publishing, arguing that writers such as Toni Morrison allegorized their experiences
						in their fiction.<br><br><em>Big Fiction</em>&nbsp;features dazzling readings of a vast range of
						novelists—including E. L. Doctorow, Judith Krantz, Renata Adler, Stephen King, Joan Didion,
						Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Patrick O’Brian, and Walter Mosley—as well as vivid portraits
						of industry figures. Written in gripping and lively prose, this deeply original book recasts the
						past six decades of American fiction.</p>

					<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ABOUT OUR SPEAKERS</strong></h2>



					<p><strong>DAN SINYKIN</strong>&nbsp;is an assistant professor of English at Emory University with a
						courtesy appointment in quantitative theory and methods. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>American
							Literature and the Long Downturn: Neoliberal Apocalypse</em>&nbsp;(2020). His writing has
						appeared in the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>,
						the&nbsp;<em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Rumpus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dissent</em>,
						and other publications.</p>



					<p><strong>TED UNDERWOOD</strong>&nbsp;is a professor in the School of Information Sciences and also
						holds an appointment with the Department of English in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
						After writing two books that describe eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature using
						familiar critical methods, he turned to new opportunities created by large digital libraries,
						using machine learning to explore patterns of literary change that become visible across
						centuries and thousands of books. His most recent project moves in the opposite direction, using
						theories of historical interpretation to guide the development of large language models.</p>



					<p>He has authored three books about literary history,&nbsp;<em>Distant Horizons&nbsp;</em>(The

					<p><em>Guest blog by ngọc triệu from the DWeb Camp Core Organizing team.</em></p>



					<p>Thank you to all who joined us in our Information Sessions and took the time to share your
						questions with us over the past month. We received a great number of inquiries and have tried
						our best to answer them in this blog post.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>If you find that your questions are not covered or if you need further clarification, please
						don’t hesitate to reach out to us at <a
							href="mailto:dweb+fellowship@archive.org">dweb+fellowship@archive.org</a>.</p>



					<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fellowship</strong></h2>



					<p><strong>Q: What are the qualities that you are looking for in Fellows?</strong><br><strong>A:
						</strong>In selecting Fellows, we seek individuals who are building or leveraging network
						technologies to uplift communities facing systemic inequality and help bring about autonomy,
						resilience, justice and social equity. Rather than adhering to a rigid set of criteria, we
						embrace diversity in backgrounds and expertises among our Fellows.</p>



					<p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/fellowships/">Learn more about the qualifications here.</a>&nbsp;
					</p>



					<p><strong>Q: How are the Fellows selected?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>The Fellows are chosen
						by the Fellowship Selection Committee, which comprises past Fellows and members of the DWeb Core
						Team. Applications will be evaluated across four key areas:</p>



					<ol>
						<li>DWeb Technology and Organizing: To what extent does the applicant utilize decentralized web
							technology and/or decentralized organizing tactics to tackle real-world challenges?</li>
					</ol>



					<ol start="2">
						<li>Community Engagement: How actively does the applicant work directly with and for
							under-resourced constituencies or marginalized communities?</li>
					</ol>



					<ol start="3">
						<li>DWeb Principles Alignment: Does the applicant and their work resonate with the values and
							spirit of the <a href="https://getdweb.net/principles/">DWeb Principles</a>?</li>
					</ol>



					<ol start="4">
						<li>Camp Participation: To what degree would the applicant benefit from attending Camp, and vice
							versa, how important is it that their perspective and experience is shared at the event for
							others to learn from?</li>
					</ol>



					<p><strong>Q: Do Fellows have to be super technical (in other words, do they need to know how to
							code)?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>No. Even though we prioritize applicants who
						have experiences developing and utilizing DWeb technologies in their work, we have also accepted
						Fellows who are not as technical in the past.&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q: What’s the best way to prepare for an application?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>The
						best way to prepare for your application is familiarize yourself with the <a
							href="https://getdweb.net/principles/">DWeb Principles</a>. You can also gain insight into
						previous Fellows and their projects: <a
							href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/07/16/introducing-the-2019-dweb-camp-global-fellows/">2019
							Fellows</a>, <a
							href="https://blog.archive.org/2022/08/25/introducing-the-2022-dweb-fellows/">2022
							Fellows</a>, <a
							href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/11/dweb-fellows-2023-lighting-the-path-towards-a-better-web/">2023
							Fellows</a>. This will help you assess whether you and your projects align well with the
						Fellowship Program.</p>



					<p>If you have a technical background, emphasize how your work relates to DWeb technologies and
						their application in real-world situations. For non-technical applicants, discuss how your work
						could benefit from DWeb technologies and outline the support or connections you are seeking for
						at Camp.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>We value brevity in responses. If you choose to apply through a written application, consider
						drafting your responses in a separate document to avoid losing your work while using a
						browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q: What kind of knowledge, skills, and/or experience do you expect Fellows to
							share?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Fellows are expected to share about the projects they
						work on and intend to present at Camp. This might encompass practical knowledge, professional
						skills, community stories, and related work experience, such as how they have utilized DWeb
						technologies to address the challenges facing their communities.&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q: What are examples of workshops or presentations that Fellows have organized at camp in
							the past?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Here are some examples of workshops and talks the
						our previous Fellows organized:&nbsp;</p>



					<ul>
						<li><em>Co-creating Terrastories</em>.&nbsp;A multi-day build-a-thon workshop where participants
							worked on improving <a href="https://terrastories.app/">Terrastories</a> (an open-source,
							offline-first app for mapping oral histories) to better suit the needs of the Haudenosaunee
							Indigenous community who are mapping traditional knowledge of water alongside scientific
							research about river contamination. Led by <a
								href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudo-kemper">Rudo Kemper</a>, 2022 Cohort and the <a
								href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/">Digital Democracy</a> team.</li>



						<li><em>Mesh Network Building Session</em><strong>.</strong> A workshop where participants
							learned how to crimp ethernet cable, build wireless links, and attach applications to the
							DWeb mesh community network. Led by <a href="https://estherjang.com/">Esther Jang</a>, 2022

					<p><strong>Q: How big will the cohort be this year?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>We aim to
						bring approximately 20 to 25 Fellows to DWeb Camp this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q. Does the Fellowship cover visa fees?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>No,
						unfortunately, we can only cover travel expenses to/from your place of origin to Camp. However,
						we can provide you with a sponsorship letter and request expedited processing for your
						visa.&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q. Does the Fellowship cover travel from where the applicant is to Camp and back? What
							about food?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Yes. If you arrive at Camp with a car, your gas
						and related expenses will be reimbursed. If you require a flight, our team collaborates with a
						travel agency to assist you in arranging your travel to and from Camp. In some cases, we can
						provide a stipend for taxi fares and meals when you’re in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>At Camp, all meals are provided, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night snacks.
						Please note that there are no financial transactions at Camp and we encourage our campers to
						bring snacks to share with the community.&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q. Do you have to know how to set up a tent?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>No. As
						Fellows, your accommodation will be provided for you. However, if you are interested in learning
						how to set up a tent, we are happy to show you how during Build Days.&nbsp;</p>



					<p><strong>Q. Where to find prior nodes? Has there been traction from Fellows to set up new nodes in
							their country beyond the US and Europe?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>You can find a <a
							href="https://getdweb.net/#nodes">listing of all DWeb nodes here</a>. Our Fellows have
						organized events and contributed to their local nodes worldwide over the past years. Last year,
						a few Fellows gathered and hosted the first <a href="https://dwebcamp.coolab.org/">DWeb Camp in
							Brazil</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.coolab.org/">CooLab</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>2. Camp Volunteer. As a Camp Volunteer, you’ll assist in setting up and taking down camp
						infrastructure, handling various kitchen duties, cleaning up, etc. You’ll be asked to work five
						3-hour shifts (total 15 hours). You’ll receive a 50% discount on your camp ticket.</p>



					<p>3. Weaver. As a Weaver, your role involves facilitating conversations among campers within small
						groups during Camp. This position is not compensated and requires the least time
						commitment.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>If you’ve ever taken a tour of the Internet Archive headquarters with Brewster Kahle, you’ve

					<p>Over the years, the area around the “Prince of Persia” station has added additional decorations,
						including a print drawn by the creator of Prince of Persia, <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
							href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/" target="_blank">Jordan Mechner</a>. Entitled <em>A
							Faithful Friend</em>, the print depicts a moment in the Prince of Persia Game where a small

						doing some readings of his <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

					<p>This provided a unique opportunity for the creator of a game that Brewster had been playing for
						years to give him tips to learn how to do a better running jump and get farther along than he
						had in his many demonstrations on the tour. It can be reported that Brewster was a fast learner
						and took Jordan’s suggestions to heart.</p>



					<p>Jordan was also kind enough to gift a signed copy of <em><a

					<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/20240318-mechnervisit"
							target="_blank">Conversation turned</a> to the Internet Archive’s help in Jordan’s work
						creating Replay, including images and research for the historical parts of the
						novel.<br><br>During the conversation, Jordan had this to say:<br><br><em>“I appreciate [The
							Internet Archive] as a graphic novelist and as a game developer. Everything I’ve done
							throughout my life has been based on inspiration that I get from other things and on
							research that I’m able to do. When I went online to write and draw this 320-page book about
							game development and about my life and my family’s history, I looked for visual references
							of everything from old postcards and photographs to video game consoles.”</em></p>



					<p><em>“I wanted to draw the floppy disk caddies and 1970s movie posters I had in my office in
							Brøderbund when I was making the first Prince of Persia on the Apple II. And where could I
							find a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/softalkv3n08apr1983"
								target="_blank">1983 April issue of Softalk magazine</a>, which is how I learned 6502
							assembly language programming? So many times, when I searched online, it was the Internet
							Archive that came through.”</em></p>

					<p>Brewster agreed:<br><br><em>“Well, I’m glad we’ve been useful to you, but also thank you for
							going and being a model for taking something that’s very, very popular in the past and
							making sure that it makes it to a generation that is going to download it from GitHub and
							play with it and mod it and do something else with it. And you’re welcoming of that next
							generation, living and growing with your work.”</em><br><br>And Jordan couldn’t have been
						clearer:</p>



					<p><em>“And I will say that I don’t feel harmed by that. A few years ago somebody took the time to
							<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lemon64.com/game/prince-of-persia"
								target="_blank">port Prince of Persia to the Commodore 64</a>, which the publisher had
							no interest in doing in 1989, because the Commodore 64 was already outdated as a platform.
							Even the Apple II was on its way out. But somebody has done it now just out of love, out of
							its challenge, and the fact that the source code was available made that easier, I
							hope.</em></p>



					<p><em>“Making things available to this generation. They’re going to do weird different things with
							it, especially if it’s not a permission-based society. But that’s what creativity has always
							been based on.“</em></p>



					<p>Jordan acknowledged: <em>“Copyright law exists and was created to protect the incentive of
							creators to work really hard at making something. So that if someone makes something great
							against all odds and it gets out there and sells a lot of copies, they can make money from
							it. But at a certain point, things that have been created need to then be used by other
							people to make their versions of it. The games and movies that we love, operas, films made
							of the works of Shakespeare, are building on creations of the past.”</em></p>

					<p>There was one last reunion in the visit: Years ago, the Archive was donated a travel case (for
						trade shows) used by Jordan’s game publisher, Brøderbund Software. It currently lives in one of
						the Internet Archive’s guest rooms, and Jordan got a quick selfie with a piece of his own
						history.</p>

					<p>As an editorial strategist and tech journalist, JD Shadel spends a lot of time thinking about how
						the content on the internet continues to rapidly evolve. One telling example they’ve followed
						closely is the evolution of GIFs. Two decades ago, the web was filled with millions of jittery,
						pixelated, handmade GIFs wherever you looked. And for many of us, there’s a nostalgia for the
						early days of the web when things felt a bit wilder and untamed.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>That nostalgia for the version of the internet they grew up with is what first sparked Shadel’s
						interest in collecting old-school GIFs. During the first months of pandemic lockdowns in 2020,
						Shadel started spending a lot of their extra spare time diving deep into the Internet Archive’s
						<a href="https://gifcities.org/">GifCities</a> collection. Shadel’s personal fascination began
						with under construction GIFs, a rich niche in the GifCities collection full of animated
						construction workers and tools. Then came seeking out GIFs of Furbies, Tamagotchi, and other
						cultural touchstones that the 33-year-old came of age with online. Over the next few years,
						downloading and organizing GIFs became a hobby for Shadel.</p>



					<p>Recently, it came time to update Shadel’s professional website. “It’s one of those evergreen
						chores it’s easy to obsess over as a freelancer, when your website is your calling card for new
						work,” said Shadel, who found themself digging back through the hundreds of GIFs they’ve curated
						thanks to the Internet Archive.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Early cyberspace-themed GIFs became the theme for their <a href="https://www.jdshadel.com/">new
							and somewhat unconventional portfolio</a>, which features more than two dozen images sourced
						entirely from GifCities. Users can, for example, click on a spinning globe for an introduction
						or a British Furby to learn about Shadel’s background as an American now based in
						London—including editorial work for outlets such as Vice, The Washington Post, and Conde Nast
						Traveler and consulting for clients including Airbnb and Adidas.</p>



					<p>“I’m so happy GifCities exists to capture that specific snapshot of the internet,” Shadel said.
						“It really relates, metaphorically, to a lot of my work where the real world and the internet
						blur, where the digital and the physical intersect.”</p>



					<p>In addition to GifCities, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> has also
						been useful to Shadel. Professionally, it is a resource when reporting and fact checking
						stories. Personally, they recently found material from a band they played in years ago.</p>



					<p>“The Internet Archive just touches my digital life in so many different ways,” Shadel said. “As a
						journalist, it’s a fact-checking tool. Having the ephemeral internet preserved for future
						researchers, writers, reporters and editors is a huge service to democracy. And it’s also just
						fun.”</p>

					<p>On the website with its <a
							href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970124032137/http://www.spacejam.com/index.cgi">Space
							Jam</a>-like navigation, Shadel wanted to reference the history of the internet — and maybe
						even inspire visitors to think more actively about their own role in charting the future. “I
						think we can reclaim our digital lives and rekindle the notion of ourselves as
						‘netizens’—citizens of the internet and not just passive participants,” Shadel said.</p>



					<p>“That’s why the work of the Internet Archive is so important,” they continued. “Despite the fact
						that we have access to more information than ever before, it’s really easy to forget digital
						histories and the lessons that we can learn from that.”</p>



					<p>Shadel’s writing touches on a range of intersecting topics—such as tech, travel and queerness—but
						the one thing they hope everyone takes away from their work is the idea that we’re all netizens
						with a role to play in shaping what we want these shared public spaces to be.&nbsp;</p>



					<p>“If we all have some shared sense of ownership of the internet, which is so involved in our
						lives, I believe we have a greater chance to make it better.” Sometimes, that can start in
						simple ways—in this case, building a DIY website with a bunch of old GIFs reminded one tech
						journalist in London that there are lessons we can take from the early internet. “We all have a
						part to play in making the internet a better place.” And at the least, they hope you enjoy the
						GIFs they’ve selected.</p>
